# 🌍 Global Student Migration Analysis (2019–2023)

# 📖 Project Overview
This project explores global student migration trends between 2019 and 2023, focusing on factors such as destination countries, scholarships, academic performance, and career outcomes. The dataset covers 5,000 students from diverse origin countries migrating to 10 major destination countries, along with their universities, fields of study, scholarships, placements, and salaries.

The analysis was conducted using Excel (data cleaning, transformations, and formula-based feature creation) and Power BI (interactive dashboards, KPIs, and storytelling visualizations).

# 🎯 Goal & Objectives
Goal: To analyze global student migration trends, scholarship distribution, university choices, and post-graduation job placements.

Objectives:

Identify the most popular destination countries and universities.

Examine the relationship between scholarships and enrollment.

Evaluate placement success rates and average salaries by destination.

Understand how GPA, scholarships, and visa policies affect employability.

Highlight the role of field of study (STEM, Business, etc.) in migration choices.

# 🛠️ Methodology & Tools
Excel (Data Preparation):

Applied formulas (IF, nested IF) to derive new columns:

ScholarFlag (Scholarship received → 1/0)

Placement Success (Placed → Successful/Unsuccessful)

Salary Category (Unemployed / Low / Medium / High)

Performance Level (Excellent / Good / Average / Poor based on GPA)

Power BI (Visualization & Dashboard):

Built KPI cards for key outcomes: Total Students, Graduation Rate, Placement Rate, Average GPA, and Salary.

Created charts (maps, bar, gauge, line) to visualize migration patterns, scholarship distribution, and job placements.

Developed a storytelling dashboard showing the journey from enrollment → graduation → employment.

# 📊 Key Insights
Top Destination: UAE, followed by USA, UK, Canada, and Germany.

Placement Success: Strongest in India, Canada, UK, and Ireland.

Highest Salary: USA offers the best average starting salaries.

Scholarships: 51.5% of students received scholarships, positively linked with placement success.

Overall Placement Rate: 50.2% of students secured jobs.

Fields of Study: STEM & Business dominate, aligning with global job market demand.

# ✅ Recommendations
Increase recruitment efforts in top destinations and high-salary fields.

Expand scholarship programs where they correlate with higher placements.

Strengthen language preparation in regions with low placement rates.

Use findings to guide universities, policymakers, and students in making data-driven migration decisions.

# 🔑 Conclusion
The analysis reveals that destination choice, academic performance, financial aid, and visa policies are the biggest drivers of student migration and employability. Using Excel and Power BI, this project highlights how data-driven insights can improve education and career planning on a global scale.
